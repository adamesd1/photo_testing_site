I can't help but feel perplexed at times when it comes to my relationship with photography. Despite the confusion and frustration that comes with it, there's something that continues to draw me back in. Is it the thrill of capturing the perfect moment, or the satisfaction of creating something truly beautiful? Or maybe it's the delusional hope that through my photography, I can make even the slightest impact on the world.

The more I delve into photography, the more it seems to resist my understanding. It's a constantly evolving art form, with new techniques and equipment constantly emerging, leaving me feeling both fascinated and overwhelmed. Yet, despite my confusion, I'm endlessly intrigued by the challenges it presents. It urges me to push myself, explore new perspectives, and seek out the hidden beauty and complexity of the world around me.

Henri Cartier-Bresson is one of the photographers that has me scratching my head the most. I mean, his work is undeniably stunning and impactful, but how does he do it? How does he manage to find the perfect composition, timing, and storytelling in a single image? I find myself both admiring and envying his skill.

As I continue to explore photography as a hobby, I often find myself struggling to find my own voice and style. There are so many different techniques, styles, and subjects to choose from, and I sometimes feel like I'm drowning in a sea of possibilities. And then there's the technical aspect of photography, with all its settings, equipment, and terminology. It's a never-ending learning curve that sometimes leaves me feeling more perplexed than ever.

In the end, I think it's this very perplexity that makes photography so interesting. There's a certain allure in the idea of delving into something so complex, yet so innately beautiful. It's a mystery that I know I'll never fully understand, but one that I'll continue to explore with curiosity. The more I try to make sense of it, the more I'm captivated by its wonder and charm.
